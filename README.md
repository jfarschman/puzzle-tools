# puzzle-tools
A place where I keep code for generating puzzles for TTRPGs.

## The Puzzles
Each of these is a seperate puzzle tool and the instructions for utilization.

A geometric puzzle where the text is hidden in plain sight (steganography) is a fun concept and this is created for my DaggerHeart campaign where the party gets a magical piece of paper so that, I (the gamemaster) can rapidly generate a clue for my party of puzzle loving players.

**Usage**

1. Download it to your system (maybe there are permissions issues)
2. Double-click it to open it.
3. Type in a message and click "Generate Grid"
4. Click "Download RTF"
5. Print it landscape.

The idea is you'll get a wall of text 14 lines with each line being 50 characters long for print.
